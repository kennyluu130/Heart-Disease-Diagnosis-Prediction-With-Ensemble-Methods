# Heart Disease Diagnosis Prediction with Ensemble Methods

## Project Description
This project applies ensemble machine learning methods to predict the presence of heart disease using patient medical records. Early and accurate detection can enable timely intervention and treatment. The analysis evaluates multiple ensemble classifiers and identifies the best-performing models for this classification task.

## Skills & Tools
**Skills:** Data preprocessing, ensemble modeling, model evaluation  
**Tools:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Dataset
The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle and contains patient records with 13 features, including age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, maximum heart rate, and more. The target variable indicates the presence (1) or absence (0) of heart disease.  

## Installation
To run the project locally:
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-disease-ensemble.git
cd heart-disease-ensemble
```
2. Install required Python packages:
```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```
3. Open the Jupyter notebook:
```
jupyter notebook heart_disease_ensemble.ipynb
```

Alternatively, the notebook can be run directly in Google Colab.
